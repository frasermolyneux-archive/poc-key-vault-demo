# POC - Key Vault Demo

This poc repository will create two demo Key Vaults:

* A public-network accessible Key Vault for demo of features/capabilities and Azure Pipelines integration.
* A private endpoint protected Key Vault for a demo of the private network features/capabilities.

## Further Considerations

Naturally, this is a limited architecture for the POC with many additional considerations required. Here are a few as a starting point:

* [Key Vault Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices)
* [Key Vault Secrets Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/secrets-best-practices)

## POC Scenarios

* General walkthrough of Key Vault features/capabilities.
* Key Vault integration with Azure Pipelines.
* Private endpoint integration with Key Vault.
